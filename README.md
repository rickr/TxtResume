# TxtResume
A little diddy to help produce a TXT record resume.

Example usage:

```ruby
me = Person.new(
  name: 'Jerry Smith',
  email: 'jerry@example.org',
  website: 'http://example.com',
  github: 'https://github.com/jerrysmith',
  blurb: 'A description about yourself',
  jobs: [
    Job.new(name: 'Advertising', years: '2011-present', blurb: 'What you did at this job'),
    Job.new(name: 'Civics', years: '2000-2011', blurb: 'what you did at this job')
  ],
  other_blurbs: [
    'One thing you did one time',
    'Another thing you did another time'
  ]
)

TxtResume.new(me).print
```

Output:

```
